Stars in my eyes
Constellations for you
You spin my life
Upside-down 'round the moon
Uh, you can't be real
You look, like
Everything I see in my dreams
I swear that
We'll be young forever
The world slows down
When we're together
I've never known this feeling
But, if I had to find a way
To explain your love
(Your love, your love, your love)
Your love feels like the rain
Feels like a song I used to know
And your love feels like the way
There's only green lights driving home
Your love feels like a Sunday
When you got nowhere to go
Oh, I love your love, your love
Your lo-lo-lo-lo-love
(Your love, your love, your love)
My life began
When you walked in the room
And I wanna end all my nights
Next to you
Like, uh
You make me complete
You look, like
Everything I see in my dreams
I swear that
We'll be young forever
The world slows down
When we're together
I've never known this feeling
But, if I had to find a way
To explain your love
(Your love, your love, your love)
Your love feels like the rain
Feels like a song I used to know (uh, uh)
And your love feels like the way
There's only green lights driving home
(Your love)
Your love feels like a Sunday
When you got nowhere to go
Oh, I love your love, your love
Your lo-lo-lo-lo-love
I swear that
We'll be young forever
The world slows down
When we're together
I've never known this feeling
But, if I had to find a way
To explain your love
(Your love, your love, your love)
Your love feels like the rain
Feels like a song I used to know (uh, uh)
And your love feels like the way
There's only green lights driving home
(Your love)
Your love feels like a Sunday
When you got nowhere to go
Oh, I love your love, your love
Your lo-lo-lo-lo-love
Your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love
